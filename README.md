# Week 9 Project â€” Katas Tour

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

To change the vibe we decided every month, 1 of the projects will be katas from codewars, similar problems as you can find on leetcode or similar website.

On this particular website, the difficulty starts with kyu8 up to kyu1.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but Iâ€™m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if Iâ€™m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this wonâ€™t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? ðŸ˜…)...well, it kinda did, didnt finish it in weekend.
